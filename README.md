**Before you begin, ensure you have the following:**

    - Node.js installed on your machine
    - GitLab account and access to the project repository
    - NEWSAPI key (you can obtain one from https://newsapi.org/)

- **Getting Started**

    - Clone the repository to your local machine:

            git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/project-mornings.git

    - Change into the project directory:

            cd project-mornings

    - Install the project dependencies:

            npm install

- **Configuration**

    - Modify the .env file in the root directory of the project:

            NEWSAPI_KEY=your-newsapi-key

    - Replace your-newsapi-key with the actual NEWSAPI key you obtained.

- **Deployment**

The frontend can be deployed using GitLab CI/CD. The .gitlab-ci.yml file is configured to deploy to a hosting platform of your choice. Update the CI/CD configuration as needed.

    - Open .gitlab-ci.yml and update the deployment section:

            deploy:
            script:
                - npm install
                - npm run build
                - ./deploy-script.sh  # Add your deployment script or commands here
            only:
                - master  # Adjust the branch to deploy from

    - Update the ./deploy-script.sh with your deployment script or commands.

    - Commit and push your changes to the GitLab repository:

            git add .
            git commit -m "Configure CI/CD deployment"
            git push origin master

    GitLab CI/CD will automatically trigger the deployment based on the configuration in .gitlab-ci.yml.
