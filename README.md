# Prerequisites

**Before you begin, ensure you have the following:**

 - Node.js installed on your machine
 - GitLab account and access to the project repository
 - NEWSAPI key (you can obtain one from https://newsapi.org/)

# Getting Started

 - Clone the repository to your local machine:

            git clone https://gitlab.com/thedockerdwelers/frontend.git

 - Change into the project directory:

            cd project-mornings

 - Install the project dependencies:

            npm install

# Configuration

 - Modify the .env file in the root directory of the project:

            NEWSAPI_KEY=your-newsapi-key

 - Replace your-newsapi-key with the actual NEWSAPI key you obtained.

# Deployment

The frontend can be deployed using GitLab CI/CD. The .gitlab-ci.yml file is configured to deploy to a hosting platform of your choice. Update the CI/CD configuration as needed.

 - Open .gitlab-ci.yml and update the deployment section:

 - Update the ./deploy-script.sh with your deployment script or commands.

 - Commit and push your changes to the GitLab repository:

            git add .
            git commit -m "Configure CI/CD deployment"
            git push origin main

GitLab CI/CD will automatically trigger the deployment based on the configuration in .gitlab-ci.yml.
